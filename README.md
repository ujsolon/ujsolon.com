## News

The **News** section on the website displays recent updates and announcements, which are loaded dynamically from the `news.json` file.

**How to update the News section:**
- Open the [`news.json`](news/news.json) file in [`/news`](https://github.com/ujsolon/ujsolon.com/tree/master/news).
- Add, edit, or remove news items in the `"posts"` array. Each item should have:
  - `title`: The headline of the news item.
  - `content`: The main text or summary.
  - `platform`: The source/platform (e.g., LinkedIn, GitHub).
  - `date`: The date in `YYYY-MM-DD` format.
  - `url`: (Optional) A link to the full post or announcement.
- Only three topmost entries in `news.json` will be shown in the HTML output.
- Rendering of the fetched results can sometimes take time. A previous CORS issue on the fetch was identified via console logs, but is not present in the Github Pages deployment.

**Example:**
```json
{
  "posts": [
    {
      "title": "Completing TechStar 2025 Journey",
      "content": "I'm thrilled to share that I've successfully completed the TechStar 2025 Program! ...",
      "platform": "LinkedIn",
      "date": "2025-08-04",
      "url": "https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7357906588973633536/"
    }
    // Add more news items here
  ]
}
```
The how page will automatically display the latest items.

## Domain and Hosting Plan

This document outlines the planned domain and hosting structure for **ujsolon.com** and related projects.

### Summary of Recommended Setup

| Purpose | Address | Platform |
|----------|----------|-----------|
| **CV / About / Links** | [ujsolon.com](https://ujsolon.com) | Static site (Vercel / GitHub Pages) |
| **Portfolio** | [portfolio.ujsolon.com](https://portfolio.ujsolon.com) | Vercel / Next.js |
| **Blog** | [blog.ujsolon.com](https://blog.ujsolon.com) ‚Üí [ujsolon.wordpress.com](https://ujsolon.wordpress.com) | WordPress (free) |

| **Future SaaS** | `appname.ujsolon.com` | Cloud deployment (AWS / Azure / GCP) |


### Notes

- **ujsolon.com** serves as the permanent root domain and main identity hub.
- Subdomains (e.g., `portfolio`, `blog`, `appname`) are used to separate content and deployments.
- **ujsolon.online** acts as a sandbox / experimental domain, to be used for up to 2 years.
- The **blog** remains hosted on WordPress free tier, accessed via subdomain redirect.
- Future SaaS or hosted apps will use subdomains under `ujsolon.com` for branding consistency.


### SSL and DNS

- All domains are managed via **Namecheap**.
- Free HTTPS certificates are provided automatically by **Vercel** or **GitHub Pages**.
- AWS deployments use **ACM certificates** for HTTPS.
- Redirects (like `news.ujsolon.com ‚Üí ujsolon.com/news`) are configured via **Namecheap URL Redirect Records**.


### Long-Term Plan

| Domain | Renewal Plan | Purpose |
|---------|---------------|----------|
| **ujsolon.com** | Renew indefinitely | Core personal / professional site |
| **ujsolon.online** | Use for 2 years, then retire | Sandbox and demo hosting |
| **ujsolon.blog** | Optional | May be replaced by `blog.ujsolon.com` redirect |
