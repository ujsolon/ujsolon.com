## Contents

### News

The **News** section on the website displays recent updates and announcements, which are loaded dynamically from the `news.json` file.

**How to update the News section:**
- Open the [`news.json`](news.json) file in the project root.
- Add, edit, or remove news items in the `"posts"` array. Each item should have:
  - `title`: The headline of the news item.
  - `content`: The main text or summary.
  - `platform`: The source/platform (e.g., LinkedIn, GitHub).
  - `date`: The date in `YYYY-MM-DD` format.
  - `url`: (Optional) A link to the full post or announcement.
- Only three topmost entries in `news.json` will be shown in the HTML output.
- Rendering of the fetched results can sometimes take time. A previous CORS issue on the fetch was identified via console logs, but is not present in the Github Pages deployment.

**Example:**
```json
{
  "posts": [
    {
      "title": "Completing TechStar 2025 Journey",
      "content": "I'm thrilled to share that I've successfully completed the TechStar 2025 Program! ...",
      "platform": "LinkedIn",
      "date": "2025-08-04",
      "url": "https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7357906588973633536/"
    }
    // Add more news items here
  ]
}
```
The website will automatically display the latest
